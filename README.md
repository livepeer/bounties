# Livepeer Bounties

Welcome to the Livepeer Software Bounties program! [Livepeer](https://livepeer.org/) is a decentralized community dedicated to building the worldâ€™s open video infrastructure. Weâ€™re thrilled to invite you to contribute and earn rewards for your efforts. Explore the [issues tab](https://github.com/livepeer/bounties/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+no%3Aassignee) to discover community-requested tasks with rewards upon completion. Several entities within the Livepeer ecosystem offer bounties, including:

- **[AI SPE](https://explorer.livepeer.org/treasury/42084921863832634370966409987770520882792921083596034115019946998721416745190)**: A special purpose entity focused on running AI jobs on the Livepeer network. Their bounties are labeled [AI](https://github.com/livepeer/bounties/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+no%3Aassignee+label%3AAI) and are funded by the Livepeer [treasury](https://dune.com/dob/livepeer-treasury).
