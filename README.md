# Livepeer Bounties

Welcome to the Livepeer Software Bounties program! [Livepeer](https://livepeer.org/) is a decentralized community dedicated to building the worldâ€™s open video infrastructure. Weâ€™re thrilled to invite you to contribute and earn rewards for your efforts. 

Explore the [open bounties](https://livepeer.notion.site/Livepeer-Bounty-Board-13b0a34856878041b9ddecaa1380b2e6) to discover community-requested tasks with rewards upon completion. The issues found in this repo mirror those created on the offical [Livepeer Bounty Board](https://livepeer.notion.site/Livepeer-Bounty-Board-13b0a34856878041b9ddecaa1380b2e6). Please apply there if interested in any of the bounties.

Several entities within the Livepeer ecosystem offer bounties, including:

- **[AI SPE](https://explorer.livepeer.org/treasury/42084921863832634370966409987770520882792921083596034115019946998721416745190)**: A special purpose entity focused on running AI jobs on the Livepeer network. Their bounties are labeled [AI](https://github.com/livepeer/bounties/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+no%3Aassignee+label%3AAI) and are funded by the Livepeer [treasury](https://dune.com/dob/livepeer-treasury).

Please note that only members of these entities can create bounties.
